## Game Rules:

1, One puzzle is played by multiple players online, who cowork together in this way : every time when a player selects one tile, 4 tiles are highlighted and magnified. which are considered to be combined with the selected one,  according to the crowd's opinio.

2, 2 indicators are placed at the left-bottom corner of the puzzle page---the steps and the time. When a user signs in, the timer starts; Every pick and combine is counted as one step. They can be hidden if you want.
